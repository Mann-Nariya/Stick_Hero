- If you click on Help you will be redirected to a screen showing the instructions for playing the game.
- Clicking on the Exit button will terminate the program.
- Clicking on the High Score button will lead to a page where you will be able to see the high score on clicking on the button.
- Clicking on the play button will lead to start of the game.
- You need to move to as much pillars as possible to gain the score and if you reach the next pillar you get one point.
- If your stick is out of the range of the pillars then you will fall from the stick and you will loose the game.
- But you will be able to continue the game if you click on the revive button, but 2 cherries will be deducted and your score will be kept in the game and your game will be resumed.
